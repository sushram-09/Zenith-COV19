# Social Distancing and Mask Detection
The world today is shaken  by the deadly virus that has bought the fast moving lives of today's modern society to an absolute stand still.
Two science-backed methods to limit the spread of the raging infection are 
* Maintaining social distance
* Wearing Masks

These measures bring down the pressure on healthcare resources and persona, while delaying the pandemic peak and also saving patients from exorbitant virus loads.
We bring a solution that automates the constant policing needed for ensuring that people follow the above precautionary measures. <br><br>
We created a program that utilizes Artificial Network to check if the social distancing norms are being followed, and other precautionary measures like the use of face masks that could possibly help in avoiding the need for future lockdown. This can automate the human task of monitoring public spaces if social distancing rules are being followed. The program uses pre-trained models like ```YOLO``` and ```FACE-NET``` to achieve the same through Computer Vision.
